			<p>Nikola Tesla (1856 – 1943) a Serbian, born in present-day Croatia. Know as a different man by many, Tesla <em>had developed a very particular thinking pattern</em>, enabling him to do many remarkable scientific contributions to the advance of the human race. Here is a brief of some of his major contributions and accomplishments.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The alternate current motor (AC), which used electrical energy to produce mechanical energy replacing the need for heavy manual labor in factories, giving room for humans to shift their focus from physical labor to more logical projects.</li>
				<li>Tesla brought to public use an efficient way to implement electricity in their business and houses, through his AC electricity.</li>
				<li>The contribution to the firsts hydroelectric plants. He exposed the safety and effectiveness of the AC current into helping generate energy from a clean font in larger scales.</li>
				<li>The spark of wireless transmission with the electric coil, largely used by radios and TVs.</li>
				<li>Impactful contributions on the development of the radio system, including the remote control by radio waves.</li>
				<li>Major role on the X Rays discovery and its dangers.</li>
				<li>He had near to 300 registered patents, while many others were hidden or stolen, as he once said: </li>
				<p id="end-quote">“I don't care that they stole my idea . . I care that they don't have any of their own”
